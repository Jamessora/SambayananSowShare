A platform where residents can list and exchange home-grown produce.

Project Info

1. Community
In bustling urban communities, residents often face the challenge of high food prices, particularly for fresh vegetables. The essence of this project is to foster unity and collaboration among urban dwellers, allowing them to leverage technology to address this issue collectively. By encouraging them to grow vegetables in their backyards and facilitating a platform where they can exchange home-grown produce, the project aims to create a self-sustainable community where residents can enjoy fresh and affordable vegetables.

2. Problem
Urban communities are grappling with the escalating prices of food items, which significantly strain many families' budgets. Fresh vegetables, a vital component of a healthy diet, have become notably expensive. Moreover, residents are largely unaware of the potential to cultivate vegetables in their own backyards, a solution that could potentially reduce costs and promote a healthier lifestyle. 

3. Solution
To address the identified problem I decided to develop of a web application platform where residents can list and exchange home-grown produce.
